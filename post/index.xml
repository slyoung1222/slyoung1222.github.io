      <description>The joys and surprises of the February garden—many of us started the month singing the praises of newly bloomed Helleborus only to find ourselves buried in snowdrifts mid-month. By month’s end, a series of sunny days quickly melted the snow and brought us to a moment garden designer Dan Pearson (2021) describes as “a notable shift from slumber.
