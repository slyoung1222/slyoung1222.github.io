<p>In March, I delved into a study of color by collecting monochromatic arrangements. As my young garden begins its fourth growing season, I’ve shifted my attention from establishing structure, boundaries, and permanent plantings to the finer details of color, texture, and ephemeral accents in the garden. Blooms and color were once an incidental or frivolous luxury in my garden work. Now they are the joyful reward of my earlier labor. Planning a succession of color has occupied my thoughts and brightened my days this winter. Along the way, some of our northern neighbors from British Columbia—Nori and Sandra Pope and Thomas Hobbs—provided magnificent inspiration.</p>
<p><img src="/images/npa_column_march_images/march_week_2.jpg" alt="Example Image 2"></p>
<p>The extraordinary Hadspen Garden in Somerset, England was lovingly made by Vancouver Island’s Nori and Sandra Pope. Their mission: “A passion for color at its finest, combined with excitement about the effect it has on perception and emotion, have become the basis for our design” (1998, p. 10). Each border was dedicated to one color, creating a monochromatic visual journey that Noël Kingsbury (2019) describes as “a garden of bewitching beauty, much of it based on experimental border plantings that play with colour, with a boldness, intellectual rigour and emotional depth that puts it in a league of its own.” Sadly, Hadspen Garden was destroyed after the Popes retired home to Canada, but I am grateful their philosophy and designs are recorded in their book Color in the Garden. The focus on one hue and its range of tints, tones, and shades delights me. While I do not plan to restrict my garden borders to monochrome plantings, I am fascinated by such focus and what it reveals. How far can a design concept be stretched? Does such devotion allow us to celebrate a color we adore and work it out of our systems? What feeling does each color invoke? The Popes suggest “a monochrome planting can hold the tension, while mixed colors cancel each other out. A hodge-podge mixture of contrasting colors can be like what happens when a monkey runs up and down a piano keyboard. Possibly something meaningful is produced, but it is not likely” (p. 50). My arrangements this month taught me to be open-minded about what makes a specific color. For instance, my Week 4 blue arrangement relies on glaucous foliage as much as it does blooms. Glaucous foliage can sometimes be read as white or grey, but in the company of blue flowers the eye sees blue. Furthermore, differences in shape and texture hold greater significance in a monochromatic arrangement since color contrasts are deemphasized. Textures and shapes play a main role in my Week 2 yellow arrangement. Cornus and Forsythia twigs arch upwards framing the hanging bells of Forsythia and Narcissus blooms which gaze upon the golden ground layer of Euonymus fortunei and miniature thyme. Week 5’s white arrangement resembles a raucous party, despite being a calming color, because of the diversity of bloom shapes (Hyacinthus ‘Carnegie’, Clematis armandii, Narcissus ‘Thalia’, and Iberis sempervirens ‘Alexander’s White’) and variegated foliage edged in white.</p>

<p>Vancouver’s Thomas Hobbs, owner of Southlands Nursery, is well known to many PNW gardeners. Perhaps it is strange to create a restricted monochromatic arrangement while studying Hobbs’ bold, “high tension” creations full of loud colors, tropical plants, and audacious foliage. In fact, when I was debating whether to experiment with the Popes’ monochromatic approach, a Hobbs design inspired me to take the plunge. A gorgeous planting from his book Shocking Color works on a scale of oranges, mixing peaches, corals, and copper as color echoes (my interpretation can be seen in Week One’s orange arrangement). Hobbs (1999) advises, “Good neighboring plants often provide a ‘color echo’ for one another. This pleases the eye because one plant or its flowers are a shade darker or lighter than its neighbor. An apricot tulip, mixed with another tulip just a shade darker, instantly becomes more interesting than a mass of all the same thing. Some leaves are variegated in cream or gold; a color echo can be picked up in a neighboring lily or any other flower with blossoms of that same shade. It always works!” (p. 47). Similarly, the color echoes in Week 3’s purple arrangement play off one another from the plum of the unopened Hyacinthus buds, Hebe tips, and Prunus foliage, while the lighter purple shades of the ornamental kale echo the open Hyacinthus blooms and serve as a pillow of light supporting the whole arrangement. Even though the arrangement is monochromatic, differences of shade have a major visual impact.</p>

<p>My Bringing the Garden Inside project has taken on a life of its own and taught me many lessons during the past few months. What began as a mindfulness practice and diversion from COVID isolation and has grown into a return to writing, the art of looking closely, and opportunities to practice garden design concepts such as repetition and color theory principles. Hobbs (1999) advises that “appreciating beauty is not a given. It is a gift. By making the effort to see just a little bit more in everything, you are using this gift, and the more you use it, the more you will get from it. As with a breadmaker or a violin or a home gym, the resulting benefits yield in direct proportion to the effort you make” (p. 6). I could not agree more.</p>
