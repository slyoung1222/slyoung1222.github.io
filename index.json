By month’s end, a series of sunny days quickly melted the snow and brought us to a moment garden designer Dan Pearson (2021) describes as “a notable shift from slumber. Bright rosettes amongst the leaf litter, looking determined and suddenly visible. Newly green amongst the darkness of foliage from last year, which is daily being pulled to earth by the earthworms and mouldering. The cycle making way and the old providing for the new as the nights become shorter.” What a roller coaster ride we have taken!\nThe snowstorms across the nation were among the biggest news in February. In my Kenmore garden, nary a hellebore was spotted for days since most plants were entirely submerged beneath white blankets. Ever the champion of winter gardens, I took advantage of this rarity by photographing a study of the visual impact of snow in the garden. Any plant who managed to peek out of the snowdrifts revealed a strong sculptural quality. But it was the garden ornaments—trellises, pots, topiary, fence-mounted plaques, an under-scallop cut into a gate door—that exhibited the boldest statements. While our decorative choices may fade into the background at summer’s peak, a good snowstorm never fails to remind us of their importance.\nNow back to those hellebores…I originally intended to feature Helleborus in all four of this month’s arrangements—especially given NPA’s affinity with the flower—but nature had other plans. Recently, I have been ruminating on repetition in planting design. As I scrutinize my plans and notes for this year’s borders, I am focusing on repetition—of a specific plant, color, or shape—to achieve a greater sense of unity in the garden. Why not start practicing by repeating a seasonal flower in my arrangements? I thought! Among the three Helleborus blooms featured this month, their colors offered a study in character. Week One’s creamy pink and green selection radiates a cheery lightness while Week Two’s burgundy tone simmers with a moodiness that I like to brighten with a zing of spring green. In the garden, burgundy can be an elegant neutral and sophisticated backdrop for literally any color while fresh spring green brightens, infusing a life force and energy to other colors. In Week Four’s arrangement, I took a different approach. Although I am not a selective Helleborus collector, some breeders strive to reproduce blooms with a dusky, frosted tone that can be read as “blue.” As shown in my photos, I collect blue and white pottery and enjoy the way red accents glow against blue and white. I hunted down the bluest hellebore I could find in the garden, strengthened the theme with Muscari blooms, and contrasted the blues with scarlet Red-osier Cornus stems and crimson Sedum ‘Dragon’s Blood’.\nPerhaps it is cabin fever or the general sense of reflection winter invites, but I have been drawn to the philosophical side of gardening this month. One of my favorite gardening figures is David Culp, hellebore breeder and owner of Brandywine Cottage garden in Pennsylvania (my home state). His generous spirit and obvious enthusiasm for plants and horticultural education always uplift. While he is eminently quotable, my favorite Culp recollection is, “Occasionally people have asked me What have you done with your life? I made a garden. […] I made a garden, trying to make a difference in the process, and it\nchanged me. As the many years pass, I seem to be melding into it, and I believe that is the best we can ask—to be at one with where we are” (2020, p.7). Like Culp, many of us spend our lives striving to make something of consequence. The thing that I do just for me that has nothing to do with anyone else is foster beauty in the world. I cannot help myself from finding it; it is as essential as oxygen. It is in my garden where I have found the perfect marriage of building a legacy and celebrating beauty.\nBeing a beauty hunter has its perks. For instance, how do you bring an arrangement inside when the garden outside is literally buried in snow? In my Week Three arrangement, I chose from plants taller than the snow (Acer branches), plants protected from complete submersion (Crocus planted in containers on my front porch), and plants overwintering (Begonia rex from pots inside the garage). Despite these limitations, beauty was possible. Likewise, who among us in the Pacific Northwest doesn’t have a lichen and moss-covered tree in their neighborhood? I once considered them rather forlorn, but I now think of them as the Countesses of Winter dripping in jewels and feathers like Bridgerton’s Ladies Danbury and Featherington. A Pennsylvania-based friend once made a beautiful vignette of lichen, moss, and twigs scavenged from my garden when she visited. She was so envious of this bounty which only thrives in much more rarified conditions where she lives. Her appreciation was a lesson in celebrating the uniqueness and beauty of our regional gifts indeed.\nWorks Cited\nCulp, D., Cowie, D., \u0026amp; Cardillo, R. (2020). A Year at Brandywine Cottage.

The opportunity to see our plants closely and in the comfort of home offers new impressions such as textural nuance, color depth, or the beauty of a silhouette. I filed this wisdom away for a time when my gardening idea box was not quite so overflowing.\nThat moment arrived in late fall 2020 during one of the most challenging years in recent history. I was desperate not to lose the healing salve that gardening had provided to me since the start of COVID. So I resolved to collect a small arrangement of cuttings from my garden each week for a year. My goal is to strengthen my connection to the ongoing life in my garden during the “off season” and to hone my eye as a planting designer to appreciate what makes plants visually appealing in winter. Three months into the project, I am pleased to share my weekly assemblages with NPA readers in a new monthly column.\nIn January, two books guided my cutting selections during our dark, wet days. The first is Rosemary Verey’s The Garden in Winter, a fast favorite of mine when I uncovered a copy in a thrift shop several years ago. Her book reviews the winter garden’s physical layout and structure, color palette of available plant material, and common seasonal jobs, including encouraging the presence of wildlife.\nThe dormant season, Verey (1988) warns, “is the absolute test of the true gardener,” a time when “the bones become apparent and the eye is not distracted by beguiling planting” (p. 7). In other words, a garden reveals its core in winter. Perhaps this explains my love of winter gardens since I have always been one who prefers to bypass social niceties to get to the heart of the matter. Through studying the resources available in winter, Verey suggests that we learn to appreciate scent, bark, early blooming bulbs, foliage, seeds and berries. Furthermore, if we widen our understanding of a plant’s life span, we extend the time that it can have visual impact in our designs. The low light of the winter sun, the effect of frost and water puddles, and the presence of wildlife are other highlights of the garden at this time of year.\nVerey advises, “If our gardens are to be more than graves commemorating summer’s beauty, we must start by using our eyes” (p. 8). I know that I have learned to use mine. During our infrequent snow flurries in the Puget Sound region, people rush outside to wonder at the view. I spend that time crowing to my indifferent husband and daughter how these moments really show if we’ve done our work as garden designers and feeling content with my efforts. While much of my satisfaction comes from the structure and layout I’ve built, some plants—namely evergreens—shine at this time of year. Some of them appear in this month’s arrangements including Skimmia japonica (oh how I could have a garden filled with only Skimmia!), Buxus, Taxus, Loropetalum, and Epimedium.\nNoël Kingsbury’s Seedheads in the Garden is the second book in my toolkit this month. He reviews some fundamental botany, covers the diversity of shape, color, and light contrast in seedheads, and explores their suitability for both naturalistic and formal gardens (not to mention their role as food sources for wildlife). Focusing on herbaceous perennials, Kingsbury (2006) observes, “Seedheads—like flowers—form a substantial part of their visual impact, whereas they are little more than extra ornamentation on those woody plants which have them” (p.11). If we refrain from deadheading all of our herbaceous plants, these seedheads can “make a substantial contribution to the overall visual impact of a garden or other planted space [from autumn through winter] and as such should be regarded as a major source of material for the planting designer.”\nKingsbury promises that cutting seedheads for an indoor arrangement gives us a close up view where “a whole wealth of detail is revealed. Many have shapes of great intricacy, the existence of which would\nnever be guessed at without taking some special effort” (p. 10). The anemone hupehensis from one of my arrangements is proof in point. I delight at how the inky black heads resemble antique silk velvet wearing away in spots. Other picks this month are starry bursts of Scabiosa stellata seedheads, rich mahogany hypericum perforatum berries, and paper crisp hydrangea paniculata seedheads. Kingsbury has inspired me to let most of my flowers go to seed this year so to observe their shapes and impact as living sculptures well past summer.\nThat said, winter arrangements require a lot of intention and creative thinking. I spend days looking around and cataloguing ideas of plants who have something special to say at this time of year. While I cannot overlook the small population of blooms in January, such as Iberis sempervirens and Ribes sanguineum, I tire of the recurring glossy evergreen foliage and faded flower heads of recent arrangements. My fatigue inspired me to work differently with my Week 4 arrangement. Initially, the cacophonous mix of russet, chartreuse, and deep pink in Heuchera ‘Marmalade’ stumped me when I tried to place it in the garden, though I eventually found a pleasing effect with burgundy and blue-grey foliage (illustrated here with Ajuga and Hebe). Still, how simple it must be to walk into the bejeweled late spring garden and find a sea of flowers imploring, “Choose me!” I suppose I shall see come April.\nWorks Cited\nKingsbury, N. (2006).

As my young garden begins its fourth growing season, I’ve shifted my attention from establishing structure, boundaries, and permanent plantings to the finer details of color, texture, and ephemeral accents in the garden. Blooms and color were once an incidental or frivolous luxury in my garden work. Now they are the joyful reward of my earlier labor. Planning a succession of color has occupied my thoughts and brightened my days this winter. Along the way, some of our northern neighbors from British Columbia—Nori and Sandra Pope and Thomas Hobbs—provided magnificent inspiration.\nThe extraordinary Hadspen Garden in Somerset, England was lovingly made by Vancouver Island’s Nori and Sandra Pope. Their mission: “A passion for color at its finest, combined with excitement about the effect it has on perception and emotion, have become the basis for our design” (1998, p. 10). Each border was dedicated to one color, creating a monochromatic visual journey that Noël Kingsbury (2019) describes as “a garden of bewitching beauty, much of it based on experimental border plantings that play with colour, with a boldness, intellectual rigour and emotional depth that puts it in a league of its own.” Sadly, Hadspen Garden was destroyed after the Popes retired home to Canada, but I am grateful their philosophy and designs are recorded in their book Color in the Garden. The focus on one hue and its range of tints, tones, and shades delights me. While I do not plan to restrict my garden borders to monochrome plantings, I am fascinated by such focus and what it reveals. How far can a design concept be stretched? Does such devotion allow us to celebrate a color we adore and work it out of our systems? What feeling does each color invoke? The Popes suggest “a monochrome planting can hold the tension, while mixed colors cancel each other out. A hodge-podge mixture of contrasting colors can be like what happens when a monkey runs up and down a piano keyboard. Possibly something meaningful is produced, but it is not likely” (p. 50). My arrangements this month taught me to be open-minded about what makes a specific color. For instance, my Week 4 blue arrangement relies on glaucous foliage as much as it does blooms. Glaucous foliage can sometimes be read as white or grey, but in the company of blue flowers the eye sees blue. Furthermore, differences in shape and texture hold greater significance in a monochromatic arrangement since color contrasts are deemphasized. Textures and shapes play a main role in my Week 2 yellow arrangement. Cornus and Forsythia twigs arch upwards framing the hanging bells of Forsythia and Narcissus blooms which gaze upon the golden ground layer of Euonymus fortunei and miniature thyme. Week 5’s white arrangement resembles a raucous party, despite being a calming color, because of the diversity of bloom shapes (Hyacinthus ‘Carnegie’, Clematis armandii, Narcissus ‘Thalia’, and Iberis sempervirens ‘Alexander’s White’) and variegated foliage edged in white.\nVancouver’s Thomas Hobbs, owner of Southlands Nursery, is well known to many PNW gardeners. Perhaps it is strange to create a restricted monochromatic arrangement while studying Hobbs’ bold, “high tension” creations full of loud colors, tropical plants, and audacious foliage. In fact, when I was debating whether to experiment with the Popes’ monochromatic approach, a Hobbs design inspired me to take the plunge. A gorgeous planting from his book Shocking Color works on a scale of oranges, mixing peaches, corals, and copper as color echoes (my interpretation can be seen in Week One’s orange arrangement). Hobbs (1999) advises, “Good neighboring plants often provide a ‘color echo’ for one another. This pleases the eye because one plant or its flowers are a shade darker or lighter than its neighbor. An apricot tulip, mixed with another tulip just a shade darker, instantly becomes more interesting than a mass of all the same thing. Some leaves are variegated in cream or gold; a color echo can be picked up in a neighboring lily or any other flower with blossoms of that same shade. It always works!” (p. 47). Similarly, the color echoes in Week 3’s purple arrangement play off one another from the plum of the unopened Hyacinthus buds, Hebe tips, and Prunus foliage, while the lighter purple shades of the ornamental kale echo the open Hyacinthus blooms and serve as a pillow of light supporting the whole arrangement. Even though the arrangement is monochromatic, differences of shade have a major visual impact.\nMy Bringing the Garden Inside project has taken on a life of its own and taught me many lessons during the past few months. What began as a mindfulness practice and diversion from COVID isolation and has grown into a return to writing, the art of looking closely, and opportunities to practice garden design concepts such as repetition and color theory principles. Hobbs (1999) advises that “appreciating beauty is not a given. It is a gift. By making the effort to see just a little bit more in everything, you are using this gift, and the more you use it, the more you will get from it. As with a breadmaker or a violin or a home gym, the resulting benefits yield in direct proportion to the effort you make” (p. 6). I could not agree more.\nWorks Cited\nHobbs, T. (1999).
