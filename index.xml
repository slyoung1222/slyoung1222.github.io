      <description>The joys and surprises of the February garden—many of us started the month singing the praises of newly bloomed Helleborus only to find ourselves buried in snowdrifts mid-month. By month’s end, a series of sunny days quickly melted the snow and brought us to a moment garden designer Dan Pearson (2021) describes as “a notable shift from slumber. Bright rosettes amongst the leaf litter, looking determined and suddenly visible. Newly green amongst the darkness of foliage from last year, which is daily being pulled to earth by the earthworms and mouldering.</description>

      <description>I once read a gardener’s advice to always keep a cutting from the garden inside the house, preferably on display in a high traffic area with lots of visibility. The opportunity to see our plants closely and in the comfort of home offers new impressions such as textural nuance, color depth, or the beauty of a silhouette. I filed this wisdom away for a time when my gardening idea box was not quite so overflowing.</description>

      <description>In March, I delved into a study of color by collecting monochromatic arrangements. As my young garden begins its fourth growing season, I’ve shifted my attention from establishing structure, boundaries, and permanent plantings to the finer details of color, texture, and ephemeral accents in the garden. Blooms and color were once an incidental or frivolous luxury in my garden work. Now they are the joyful reward of my earlier labor. Planning a succession of color has occupied my thoughts and brightened my days this winter.</description>
